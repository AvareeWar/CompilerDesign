		Regular Expressions
			(Machine = Finite State Automata)    Context Free Grammars C Context Sensitive Grammars(machine = turing machines)

			Not Context Free:	aaabbbccc - there has to be as many b's and c's as there are a's


			w = aaba  		aaba/w	c/c 	abaa/w^R

				Regular Expressions are recognized by CFGs with productions restricetd to either:
					A -> a B, or C -> d
						Example: (ab)*bab:
							S -> a b s
							S -> b a b

							or 

							S -> a T
							S -> b U
							T -> b S
							U -> a V
							V -> b


				Derivations:
		● If A -> γ is a production, then
		– αAβ => αγβ is one step of a derivation
		– αAβ =>+ αγβ is one or more steps
		– αAβ =>* αγβ is zero or more steps
		● SF(G): the sentential forms of the context-free
		grammar G:
		– SF(G) = {S =>* β}
		● L(G): The language (terminals only) of grammar G:
		– L(G) = {w ∈ Σ*
		|N =>+ w}
